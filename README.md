### Lauch LeRobot 
We feel like it's time to help a much larger open-source community to emerge in robotics 
and connect/merge with the recent progress in LLM and multimodal models bringing 
all the diversity/excitation of community there.

### Github LeRobot 
 LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulation environments to get started without assembling a robot. In the coming weeks, the plan is to add more and more support for real-world robotics on the most affordable and capable robots out there.

ðŸ¤— LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on this Hugging Face community page: huggingface.co/lerobot
